# TechLabs Sommer26: Machine Learning Fundamentals

Welcome to the learning phase of your Data Science journey! Over the next 6 weeks, you will learn the fundamentals of Python, Data Wrangling, and Machine Learning by solving the **Spaceship Titanic** challenge.

## 🚀 The Mission
The year is 2912. The spaceship *Titanic* was an interstellar passenger liner. While rounding Alpha Centauri, it collided with a space-time anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Almost half of the passengers were transported to another dimension! 

**Your goal:** Predict which passengers were transported using records recovered from the ship’s damaged computer system.

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. **Fork this repository:**
   Click the **"Fork"** button at the top right of this GitHub page. This creates a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your GitHub]/Assignments-DataScience.git
   cd Assignments-DataScience
   ```

3. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **The Data:**
   The `train.csv` file is already provided in the `data/` folder. You can use this for all your analysis and modeling.
   Please do not delete the file, as you will need it throughout the assignments.
   Also make sure, that you do not override this file and keep it in this version.

7. **Testing:**
   You can test your own code by running the corresponding terminal command as it is written for each assignment.
   Please do not delete or change the code inside the `tests/` folder
